# Web Vulnerability Journal

This repository is my personal journey into learning web vulnerabilities and injections.  
It serves as a tracker for labs, write-ups, payloads, and notes.

## 📌 Current Focus
See [CURRENT.md](CURRENT.md) for the topic I'm currently working on.

## 📊 Progress Tracker
Track your overall progress, dates, and notes in [TRACKER.md](TRACKER.md).

## 🛣 Learning Path
- **SQLi → Authentication bypass → XSS**  
- **Command Injection → Path Traversal → File Upload**  
- **XXE → NoSQLi → SSRF**  
- **Access Control → Business Logic → Information Disclosure**  
- **CSRF → DOM-based XSS**  
- Later: Race Conditions, CORS, Clickjacking, WebSockets, CRLF Injection, API Testing

## 🗂 Folder Structure
- `labs/` : Vulnerability-specific lab write-ups  
- `misc/` : Reusable payloads and general notes  
- `CURRENT.md` : Current topic in progress  
- `TRACKER.md` : Progress table with dates and completed labs

## 📝 How to Use
1. Document each lab in its respective folder: `labs/<vulnerability>/lab-name.md`  
2. Track your progress, dates, and observations in `TRACKER.md`  
3. Collect commonly used payloads and notes in `misc/payloads.md`
